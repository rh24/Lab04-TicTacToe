# Tic Tac Toe

This is a Tic Tac Toe board game that has been turned into a .NET Core console application written in C#. The purpose of this project is to practice object oriented programming principles, wherein classes serve as templates for object instantiations. Each class has its unique properties that may be get and set.

## How to get started

To fire up this console application, open up Visual Studio and start up the appliction via `Ctrl + f5`. This will run the application without running the debugger. Make sure you double click on the `Lab04_TicTacToe.sln` file within the root directory of the repository. Otherwise, you will not be able to execute the code without hitting a `System.IO.FileNotFoundException`. This is very important.

Follow the prompts to alternate players. X is always the starting player. O will go second until a winner is determined.
